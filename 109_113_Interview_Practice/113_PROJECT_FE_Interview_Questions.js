BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS
*/


/*
1. What is the most influential book or blog post you’ve read regarding front-end development?
To me, the most influential book/post is the one that is the most clear and usable a resource. 
For me, that is the tounge-in-cheek guide to Javascript "Ugh, Code. I read it as my first look 
at Javascript and, while the details of the project I completed have faded, I continue to appreciate
the authors scoping skills and ability to share the right level of detail with his students. This 
flexibility is a skill I try to emulate whenever I am in a position to explain something to others or
need to adjust my own process.
*/

/*
If you could master one technology this year, what would it be and why?
I would like to learn more about Python's data analysis libraries. As I grow as a web developer, I
expect that I will become more intregrated into my team's decision-making, and I want to be able
to base my recommendations on the data we have from our users and be able to analyze that effectively.
*/


/*
Describe any front-end web application framework (preferably one that you use). How does it work? What are the upsides and downsides?
It's important to remember that React was built as a JS library for building user interfaces. Because
React isn't a full framework, some tasks are left to 3rd parties (you get to choose!). This means that 
there is far more choice than a lot if beginners are ready for and best practice can be murky. 
However, because it is so popular there are an abundence of training resources. It's a good choice (note to self: why?)
for cross-platform work. Because your view is rerendered but uses declaritive components, it's performant. No explicit 
data binding means that you don't have to wire your view to your model manually and instead uses one render function
which returns your view and calls it recursively.
(Girl, this is word salad, you need to go back and learn more.)
*/

/*
Write a JavaScript function that takes only one argument——another function——and returns a "memoized" version of that function. A "memoized" version of a function caches and returns the results of its call so that when it is called again with the same input, it doesn’t run its computation but instead returns the results from cache. Note that previous results should be retrievable in any order without re-computation.

Come back and finish this after you learn more. :p
